Digital Identity Management is not a replacement discovery within the Information Technology world. Since Ancient Roman times, Passwords have been the ultimate keepers of diversity and
security[5]. Even today, they are used to prove oneâ€™s worth for obtaining some privilege others do not possess, but strongly desire to get. However, over the years with the emergence of the web, Identity Management has transformed through several phases, although maintaining the same goals of,

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Authentication - Verifying that an individual is who they claim to be.
    \item Authorization - Providing them access to some associated resources or services.
\end{enumerate}

These two goals, authentication, and authorization are the backbone of access control[6] and work together to get the specified trust necessary to supply resources or services to assumed unknown persons.
